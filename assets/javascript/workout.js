      <li><span class="bold">Step 1</span> Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor and bring your feet together behind you.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 2</span> Slowly bend forward to place your palms flat on the mat, positioning your hands shoulder-width apart with your fingers facing forward or turned slightly inward. 
      Slowly shift your weight forward until your shoulders are positioned directly over your hands. 
      Reposition your hands as needed to allow full extension of your body without any bend at the hips or knees. 
      Stiffen your torso by contracting your core/abdominal muscles ("bracing"), your glute and quadriceps muscles and align your head with your spine. 
      Place your feet together with your ankles dorsiflexed (toes pointed towards your shins).</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 3</span> Downward Phase: Slowly lower your body towards the floor while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. 
      Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards during this downward phase. 
      Continue to lower yourself until your chest or chin touch the mat/floor. 
      Allow your elbows to flare outwards during the lowering phase.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 4</span> Upward Phase: Press upwards through your arms while maintaining a rigid torso and head aligned with your spine. 
      For extra strength think about pushing the floor away from you. 
      Do not allow your low back to sag or your hips to hike upwards. 
      Continue pressing until the arms are fully extended at the elbows.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 5</span> An alternative position is to turn your hands to face forwards and keep your your elbows close to your sides during the downward phase. 
      This shifts the emphasis from the chest muscles onto the triceps and may reduce stresses in the shoulder joint.
      Pushing through the heel and outside surface of your palm provides greater force in your press and stability to your shoulders.</li>

      <li><span class="bold">Step 2</span> Place your hands behind your head, squeezing your scapulae (shoulder blades) together and pulling your elbows back without arching your low back. 
      This elbow position should be maintained throughout the exercise. 
      Align your head with your spine, but allow it to move into slight flexion (moving the chin towards the chest) during the upward phase of the exercise.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 3</span> Upward Phase: Exhale, contract your abdominal and core muscles and flex your chin slightly towards your chest while slowly curling your torso towards your thighs. 
      The movement should focus on pulling your rib cage towards your pelvis (the neck stays relaxed while the chin is tucked towards the neck). 
      Your feet, tailbone and lower back should remain in contact with the mat at all times. Continue curling up until your upper back is lifted off the mat. Hold this position briefly.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 4</span> Downward Phase: Gently inhale and slowly uncurl (lower) your torso back towards the mat in a controlled fashion keeping your feet, tailbone and low back in contact with the mat.
      Proper form is important for this exercise to prevent excessive stress on your low back. 
      Individuals usually perform this movement too rapidly and recruit the hip flexors to assist with the upward phase. 
      This technique tilts the pelvis anteriorly, increasing the stress on the low back and should be avoided. 
      The abdominals connect the rib cage to the pelvis so the movement should focus on bringing these two body parts closer together while keeping the neck and shoulders relaxed.</li>

      Downward Phase: Begin your downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then slowly moving downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your knees. 
      Continue to lower yourself until your feel your heels about to lift off the floor. 
      Try to maintain a flat back by bending forward at the hips, keep your head facing forward and position to your arms where comfortable or where they offer the greatest degree of balance support.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 2</span> Jumping Movement: With ONLY a very brief pause at the bottom of your downward phase, explode upwards through your lower extremity, achieving triple extension (pushing and extending your ankles, knees and hips simultaneously). 
      As you jump into the air, keep your feet level with each other and parallel with the floor.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 3</span> Landing: The most important components of the landing phase are correct foot position and avoiding excessive forward movement in your lower extremity which places additional stresses upon your knees. 
      Attempt to land softly and quietly on the mid-foot, rolling backwards quickly towards the heels. 
      Always push your hips backwards and drop them downwards to absorb the impacting forces associated with jumping. 
      Avoid locking out your knees or quads on your landing as this may lead to potential knee injuries.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 4</span> Exercise Variation: Perform repeated jumps with no rest in between each repetition.
      It is suggested, you first learn how to squat and land before attempting to jump. 
      Once you have mastered the hip-hinge mechanism, begin with small jumps, but emphasize your landing mechanics. 
      Only progress to more explosive jumps once you have mastered your landing mechanics.</li>

      Attempt to avoid shrugging your shoulder upwards.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 2</span> pward Phase: Slowly step to place your right foot on a platform, placing your foot firmly on the deck while keeping your torso upright and aligning your knee over your second toe. 
      Push off with the trailing (left) leg to raise your body onto the platform placing that foot alongside your leading (right) foot. 
      During this transition, your torso and your right tibia (shinbone) will move slightly forward past vertical, but try to avoid excessive forward movement.</li>
      <li><span class="bold">Step 3</span> Downward Phase: Slowly load the weight of your body into your leading (right) foot, step backwards to place the trailing (left) foot on the floor in its starting position. 
      Allow your body to lean slightly forward during the step-down movement. Load your weight into your trailing (left) foot and step off the platform with your leading (right) foot, returning to your starting position.

      <li><span class="bold">Step 3</span> As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. 
      This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. 
      Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean.
